A hard working developer with a varied skillset, seeking a new role within a challenging working environment.

Education
---------

*   Computer Science BSc 2:1 , University of Manchester, United Kingdom
*   Saint Malachyâ€™s College, Belfast, Northern Ireland

Skills
---------------

*   **Paradigms**   
   - Strong OOP and functional skills.
   - Full understanding of GRASP principles and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code.
   - Comprehensive knowledge of why a certain language would or would not suit a particular use case, depending on the given non-functional requirements.   

*   **DevOps**   
   - Extensive DevOps experience in both previous and current roles, including the setup and maintenance of (but not limited to): K8s, Docker, Kafka, GCP (appengine, cloud scheduler, cloudtasks, dataflow, bigquery, spanner, buckets), AWS (ec2), Redis, Ansible, Chef, Vagrant/Virtualbox. Entrusted with DBA and sysadmin responsibilities on BPOR project.   
   - Docker use both in roles and learning in my spare time. Created a reusable skeleton for a highly scalable microservice application which uses the kafka messaging queue within a k8s cluster (to stream logs).
   - Experience with EMQTT and rabbitMQ, hence familiarity with the MQTT and AMQP protocols.

*   **Linux**   
   - Linux distros used almost exclusively for the last 6-7 years. Regularly asked for help by colleagues on other teams. Can set up and maintain users/ssh keys/systemd files/host file settings/ip tables/mysql dbs and other sysadmin tasks with ease.   
   - Avid command line user and will almost never be seen using a GUI if there is a commandline version.
   - Always writes scripts for repeated tasks to complement documentation, rather than just documentation.
   - Always creating and sharing aliases, to increase personal efficiency and that of others.

*   **Writing RESTful APIs and clients**   
Has written APIs in multiple frameworks, a firm understanding of inversion of control through dependency injection and is quick to learn new technologies. A strong awareness of the types of security vulnerabilities that are present when connecting clients to such APIs.

*   **Languages**
    - Java, Javascrjpt, Golang, Erlang, C, Python, Ruby and C++ to varying degrees throughout my career.
    - A keen interest in compilers and formal language theory. This has been realised through the creation of a transpiler called "Alfalfa" which allows developers to generate API endpoints extremely quickly, as well as the client libraries for those APIs.  
    
EMPLOYMENT
---------

*   **Consultant Analyst, PA Consulting, Belfast UK.** (November 2018 - present)

    *Lead Developer, Rentokil North America Enablement*
    - Created 2 POCs, to enable replication of data from an IBM as400 machine to a cloud based backend, to lay the foundation for the client to migrate to the cloud. One using apache beam (GCP dataflow), the other using cloud tasks.

    - Had serious input into the architecture of the decided upon approach. Currently retrieving data from the big query table it is backed up to, via a java appEngine app, to post to a GCP task queue (a suggestion for kafka was made), which then posts the task to a taskHandler which currently transforms the data to their old schema, but it is decoupled enough that we can switch that out whenever they have went fully cloud native.

    - Worked alongside an architect who was assigned to the project 2/5 days per week. Solely responsible for the coding of the POCs which got the new work order funding approved for 3 more months, as well as the implementation of the final solution.
